# Sites

Sites represent venues in the Beco system - shopping malls, airports, hospitals, or corporate campuses. This guide explains how to work with BCSite objects and the venue hierarchy.

## Overview

:::info Site Context
A site is the entry point for indoor mapping operations. Sites contain metadata including address information, contact details, operating hours, and geographic coordinates.
:::

### Hierarchy Structure

:::note Data Organization
Understanding the hierarchical structure is essential for effective venue navigation.
:::

```text
BCSite (Top Level)
├── Building 1
│   ├── Floor 1 (Ground Floor)
│   │   ├── Location 1 (Store A)
│   │   ├── Location 2 (Restaurant B)
│   │   └── Location 3 (Restroom)
│   └── Floor 2 (First Floor)
└── Building 2
    └── Floor 1 (Ground Floor)
```

**Levels:**
- **Site**: Top-level venue
- **Buildings**: Physical structures within the site
- **Floors**: Horizontal levels within each building
- **Locations**: Points of interest on each floor

## BCSite Properties

**Core Information:**
- `siteName` - Display name of the venue
- `id` - Unique identifier for the site
- `address` - Street address
- `city` - City location
- `buildings` - Array of BCBuilding objects

**Geographic Data:**
- `center` - Geographic center coordinates [longitude, latitude]
- `tzId` - Timezone identifier

**Operational Data:**
- `operationHours` - Array of BCOperationHour objects

## Working with Sites

### Accessing Site Information

<Tabs hasCode>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: BCMapView, didRenderSite site: BCSite) {
    print("Site Name: \(site.siteName ?? "Unknown")")
    print("Buildings: \(site.buildings.count)")

    // Access buildings and floors
    for building in site.buildings {
        print("Building: \(building.name ?? "Unknown")")
        if let floors = building.floors {
            for floor in floors {
                print("  Floor: \(floor.name ?? "Unknown")")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="objc" label="Objective-C">

```objc
- (void)mapView:(BCMapView *)mapView didRenderSite:(BCSite *)site {
    NSLog(@"Site Name: %@", site.siteName ?: @"Unknown");
    NSLog(@"Buildings: %lu", (unsigned long)site.buildings.count);

    // Access buildings and floors
    for (BCBuilding *building in site.buildings) {
        NSLog(@"Building: %@", building.name ?: @"Unknown");
        if (building.floors) {
            for (BCMapFloor *floor in building.floors) {
                NSLog(@"  Floor: %@", floor.name ?: @"Unknown");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Finding Floors by ID

<Tabs hasCode>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: BCMapView, didRenderSite site: BCSite) {
    // Find a specific floor by ID
    if let targetFloor = site.getFloor(withId: "floor-id-123") {
        print("Found floor: \(targetFloor.name ?? "Unknown")")
        mapView.selectFloor(floor: targetFloor)
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="objc" label="Objective-C">

```objc
- (void)mapView:(BCMapView *)mapView didRenderSite:(BCSite *)site {
    // Find a specific floor by ID
    BCMapFloor *targetFloor = [site getFloorWithId:@"floor-id-123"];
    if (targetFloor) {
        NSLog(@"Found floor: %@", targetFloor.name ?: @"Unknown");
        [mapView selectFloor:targetFloor];
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

- **Validate site data** before using it in your application
- **Store site reference** for later use after successful loading
- **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
- **Check for empty buildings/floors** before accessing floor data

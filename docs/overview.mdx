## Quick Start

### Basic Setup

<Tabs hasCode>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">

```swift
import UIKit
import becomap_ios

class MapViewController: UIViewController {
    var mapView: BCMapView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setupMapView()
    }
    
    private func setupMapView() {
        mapView = BCMapView()
        mapView.delegate = self
        view.addSubview(mapView)
        
        // Setup constraints
        mapView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            mapView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor),
            mapView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),
            mapView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),
            mapView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor)
        ])
        
        // Load your site
        mapView.renderSiteWith(
            clientId: "your_client_id",
            clientSecret: "your_client_secret",
            siteId: "your_site_id"
        )
    }
}

extension MapViewController: BCMapViewDelegate {
    func mapView(_ mapView: BCMapView, didRenderSite site: BCSite) {
        print("✅ Site loaded: \(site.siteName ?? "Unknown")")
    }
    
    func mapView(_ mapView: BCMapView, didReceiveError payload: Any) {
        print("❌ Error: \(payload)")
    }
    
    func mapView(_ mapView: BCMapView, didLoadData success: Bool) {
        if success {
            let locations = mapView.getLocations()
            let categories = mapView.getCategories()
            print("Loaded \(locations.count) locations, \(categories.count) categories")
        }
    }
}

## Architecture

:::info Hybrid Architecture
The iOS SDK provides a hybrid architecture that combines the best of native iOS performance with advanced mapping technologies.
:::

The iOS SDK provides a hybrid architecture that combines:

- **Native iOS Performance**: Swift-based framework with native UI integration
- **High-Performance Caching**: O(1) lookup with thread-safe concurrent access
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous bridge between JavaScript and native layers
- **Type-Safe Models**: Comprehensive Swift models with JSON parsing

## Core Components

:::note SDK Components
Understanding these core components is essential for effective SDK integration.
:::

### BCMapView
The main view class that displays indoor maps and handles user interactions.

### BCMapViewDelegate
Protocol for receiving map events, data loading, and user interactions.

### Data Models
- **BCSite**: Venue information with buildings and floors
- **BCLocation**: Points of interest within the venue
- **BCMapFloor**: Floor information and metadata
- **BCRouteSegment**: Navigation route segments
- **BCCategory**: Location categories for filtering

### Cache System
:::tip High Performance
High-performance caching system that provides optimal data access after initial loading.
:::

High-performance caching system that provides:
- **Synchronous data access** after initial loading
- **Thread-safe operations** with concurrent queue
- **O(1) lookup performance** for all cached data
- **Automatic cache population** after site loading

## Data Access Methods

:::warning Data Availability
After the `didLoadData` callback, you can access venue data synchronously.
:::

After the `didLoadData` callback, you can access venue data synchronously:

- `getLocations()` - All locations in the venue
- `getCategories()` - All location categories
- `getAmenityLocations()` - All amenity locations
- `getAmenityTypes()` - Available amenity types
- `getHappenings(type:)` - Events, offers, and news
